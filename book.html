            <summary>Inspiration</summary>
            <p>
              I'd say after watching two seasons of Young Justice, the idea of
              Bait started to form in my head and I started writing it out. It
              does follow the first two seasons loosely before branching out to
              its own thing. So of course, spoiler alert if you plan to watch
              Young Justice. Or watch it first and go back to this. Did alter
              and add some stuff from the beginning of season 3. Other sources
              of inspiration that helped shaped Bait came from numerous Batman
              comics, DC movies, real life, etc.

            <summary>Structure</summary>
            <p>
              First, it's not a comic book or a book. I think it's more like a
              script encompassing the general overview of the character. As
              stated above, it's based loosely on the Young Justice TV show. As
              for "explicit content", I don't believe it's that bad but read at
              your own risk.

              I started it on October 2021 and finished it finally on May 2022.

            <summary>Why Did I Write This?</summary>
            <p>
              Believe or not, it was to stimulate my brain while writing my
              graduate school applications. Writing application essays are not
              exciting, and oftentimes I hit a wall on what to write. So, to
              stimulate myself, I started writing this. It helped and soon, I
              thought I could create a synopsis for a DC character. It became my
              favorite pastime for a while because it was fun writing my ideas
              into words and developing it into a story.

            <summary>Drawings?</summary>
            <p>
              No drawings, unfortunately. Even the title page or symbol for the
              character. I'm atrocious at drawing, and I know there should be an
              idea of what my character looks like. Or anything that is going on
              in the book since it's supposed to be a comic. But I suppose you
              can use your own imagination.

          <details>
            <summary>Will Bait Be Part Of DC Comics?</summary>
            <p>
              If you liked the script and want to see Bait be part of DC Comics,
              I'm flattered and I thank you. If you didn't like it, all good.
              Either way, thanks for taking the time to read it. But honestly, I
              don't think so. First, with all the characters DC has, Bait is
              probably not unique. I don't know every character in DC though and
              this one may be redudant (is that how you spell it. There's no
              spellchecker in HTML!). Second, perhaps his story is boring,
              reptitive, and offer no new value for DC Comics. Third, I have no
              ideal way of pitching this idea and I don't want waste their time
              on a likely boring character idea. But if I do bump into someone
              from DC Comics accidentally, I probably will ask him/her to take a
              look. When I wrote this, it was for fun and at no point during
              writing I was thinking about this idea being picked up. As you can
              probably tell, writing is not my forte but this was for fun and
              not for anyone or anything. But I won't deny it would be cool if
              this character idea resonates well. Even if I like it, it's not
              good to push this onto other people. So I leave this here for
              others who want to read and see an idea.

            <summary>Bait's Role</summary>
            <p>
              I really hesistate calling Bait a superhero. Superhero always
              means there are superpowers, but Bait doesn't have them. He does
              have some exceptional, yet mundane, qualities, such as being an
              expert marksman and great at hand to hand combat. I tried to
              portray him as someone who is cold and never takes anything
              personal when doing crime fighting but I don't think I achieved
              that. Also, very level-headed and is there to help defuse
              situations first. And to make himself the "bait" or like setting
              up traps. Pivoting to what I said above, if Batman is considered a
              superhero, then Bait I guess he can be a minor superhero. True to
              his heritage, he is someone who works in the shadows. Also very
              loyal to the Batman and will always do his best to be avaliable if
              called on. Mixture of Alfred and Robin's relationship to Batman.

            <summary>Additional Bait Story Ideas</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I think the one I really wanted was him facing off the Batman
                Who Laughs. Feels that enemy suits him well but I didn't
                incorporate it because I thought the book was getting way too
                long. And if I was, I want to read all the comics that BWL is in
                and devise a story based off that.
              </li>
              <li>
                An event set in cyberpunk setting. Cyberpunk 2077, Blade Runner,
                Blade Runner 2049, and others piqued my interest in the
                cyberpunk genre. Perhaps it's the inclusion of noir element as
                well that makes it appealing.
