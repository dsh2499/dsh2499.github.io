          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hej, the name David. Last name Hu. Pronounced like "who" not "hue".
            If you pronounce that s**t "hue", you are dishonoring my ancestors
            on my father's side. Not that you have to honor them anyway. But if
            you pronounce my last name correctly, you get to make punny jokes at
            my expense. Had my fair share of those in elementary school. Didn't
            find it funny, but not in "You're mean" feeling, but more like "I
            don't see the humor" even if I understood the joke. So, the reaction
            you'll get from me today most likely is "oh, ha" and then awkward
            silence. Maybe I'll make it even more awkward by asking if you ever
            stay frosty and then make you eat kaboucha squash. On the rare
            chance, if I double over in laughter, that probably means I have a
            massive crush on you or I need you for a big favor. Middle name is
            Shih but nothing good phonetically for that one, so pronounce how
            ever you want :D.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my humblest opinion, something about me that would make you go
            "oh, that's cool" was that I graduated from Cornell University. The
            one in Ithaca, New York. Majored in Biometry and Statistics. I
            cannot tell you why it's called Biometry & Statistics. It's not
            depressing as they say but I'm not a good evaluator since I was
            already depressed before going there. HA! I probably went to far,
            sorry, I will take a sensitvity course by becoming clinically
            depressed myself. Sometimes, I wonder if I have some sort of
            depression or personality disorder. I'm awful at small talk. Don't
            even get me started on networking. Will I ever go back to visit
            Cornell? Only for my sister's graduation or to relive my days on
            slipping on ice during the winter. CS 2800 made me feel like a
            legitimate dumba** and I am grateful for the professor for passing
            me even though I had an uncurved F in that class. There were several
            others, but that one stood out the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, to start of on my hobbies. I like to keep active, but not enough
            to shed this uncessary fat off me, by playing tennis. Playing tennis
            isn't going to cut it; I have to work out as well. Tennis is my
            favorite sport and I hope so since I've been playing since middle
            school. Got the fortunate opportunity to play for my high school
            team. Not spectacular, as I spent primarily my four years on junior
            varisity with some starts at varsity if it was against a weaker
            team. Won two VCJTA tournaments but get this, never won a game
            during USTA play. S**t was embarassing. Never had the mental
            strength during competitive play and always lost confidence as soon
            as I felt something was off. But playing for fun, that's fun. Play
            with my dad and sister (who is way better than me) whenever possible
            and weather permits. Goal is to try grass and clay courts before my
            knees give out arrgggh. Funny thing is I rarely watch tennis matches
            on TV even though every time I watch I see it as a learning
            experience and how I can get better. It's not jealously, I swear,
            it's just I prefer to watch other things, if you know what I mean.
            You probably don't and this is why I'm unemployed.
            <br /><br />
            Other sports I like to partake in are basketball and swimming.
            Basketball was the first sport I picked up and I like shooting
            because making ball go in hoop gives seratonin. But seratonin
            doesn't come often when I shoot outside of the key. Swimming, it was
            something I was taught by my dad and another form of exercise. Not
            good at it, but using full body to propel myself and being in the
            water feels nice. Still don't know how to frontflip when switching
            directions without getting water up my nose and a sense of nausea.
          </p>
          <p>
            I won't say everything I like doing because this isn't a 'list what
            I like to do' page and some stuff is embarassing to be immortalized
            on the Internet. Back to why I don't watch tennis often. I don't
            because I prefer to watch motorsports or other sports (NBA or MLB)
            if I watch live sports. First, motorsports. I enjoy F1, Indycar, and
            NASCAR. The favorite though is NASCAR by a lot. Grew up with it
            being a kid originally from Midwest. So, love watching NASCAR and
            collecting diecast. Can take a look if you want of my more cherished
            ones but I may just put my whole collection on there for giggles.
            This is also why I don't have a girlfriend but there are more
            important reasons other than using my money on diecast collecting.
            It's a fun hobby but I'm getting a feeling of law of dimishing
            returns everytime I buy one.
            <br /><br />
            Of course, I like playing video games. I see these PC gaming
            stations and am jealous. Future goal, that is. And not so sure if I
            really want to invest that much money into video games. I would like
            thank my parents for the PS3 that I have been playing on for 10+
            years and still have a blast on. Favorite games include GTA, Grid,
            Gran Turismo, and MLB The Show. The PS5 looks really cool, and
            perhaps it's time I experience the latest video game technology, but
            no reason for it right now. Only thing I'll get PS5 is for Gran
            Turismo 7.
          </p>
          <p>
            But my most favorite thing to do is spend time with family. It gives
            me the greatest sense of fullfillment even if sometimes I'd rather
            stay home or be alone. Do enjoy talking with my sister. It's going
            to harder to see each other in person because of our lives now. I'm
            proud of her and think she will go far in life. More than me, that's
            for sure.

          <h3>Why Did I Make A Website?</h3>
          <p>
            I promise you, I'm not trying to break in as a front, middle, and
            back end developer. So, this isn't my portfolio and is quite basic.
            I honestly should be doing statistical projects instead but web
            development was more alluring. Still have so much to go, especially
            making a webpage "responsive" (like using additional CSS units
            besides "px) and some other cool stuff, like React.js ?? Not to
            mention the theory behind all this, which is important because I
            have a computer science minor and really understanding it can help
            me solve why I don't like eating cherry tomatoes. Overall, pretty
            nice to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My summer project, I
            suppose. A part of me likes to build things from the ground up, and
            I was always curious how websites and built and decided to go for
            it. Lots of videos to learn from. But now to the big reason. I could
            go on and on on some bulls**t that I'm a curious boi but that's a
            lie. Now, here's the major reason. A project in my CS class during
            my senior year of college needed us to add on an 'user interface' or
            something that required a webpage to display our project. It was a
            search engine and we had to display results somehow. Well, I was the
            only one who didn't know HTML and was so confused and helpless. Lot
            of times during my CS group projects I was the village idiot but
            made sure to contribute something, even if it was basic stuff. Very
            embarassing and so it was on the back of mind that one day I'll
            learn HTML. Now, had no idea JavaScript and CSS were involved and
            probably much more. My page is not that responsive, so please view
            in full browser for best experience please and thanks. It's also
            important to drink water, please drink some water. I don't want this
            page to become my political thoughts but flavored sparkling water is
            a joke, just drink regular sparkling water. I like regular sparkling
            water :D.

        <h2>My CV</h2>
        <p>
          As you can see, it's quite barren for someone who wishes to make a
          career in the statistical field. Honestly, this page will probably be
          visited by recruiters the most and they probably will think, "Damn,
          for a guy who went to Cornell, that's all he got? Is he expecting a
          job based off this?". No, not really, and that's why graduate school
          was my next step. Will try my best to change that by hopefully getting
          involved or doing outside projects outside of class to show that I am
          competent in statistics. I could go on a long winded answer why my
          resumé is a joke, but that's for another day. Maybe I become compotent
          and there can be another page discussing cool statistical stuff I've
          worked on.
